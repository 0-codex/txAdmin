## Installing & Running (Windows/Linux)

If your copy of fxserver doesn't come with txAdmin (`citizen/system_resources/txAdmin`), you can install with the following steps:

```bash
#Inside your fxserver folder, execute:
cd citizen/system_resources
mv monitor monitorOld
git clone -b conversion https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin monitor
cd monitor
npm i
```

Then to run it, just execute the `run.sh` or `run.cmd` without **any** `+exec` arguments.  
An `txData` folder will be created in your current working directory.  

### ConVars
- **serverProfile:** The name of the server profile to start. Profiles are saved/loaded from the current directory inside the `txData` folder.
- **txAdminPort:** The TCP port to use as HTTP Server.

ConVar usage example on Windows:  
```bash
./run.cmd +set serverProfile dev_server +set txAdminPort 40125
```
