## Features
- Start/Stop/Restart your server instance or resources
- Access control via multiple credentials and action logging
- Discord integration (for now, just the /status command)
- Monitor serverâ€™s CPU/RAM consumption
- Real-time playerlist with ping + steam-linked accounts (when available)
- OneSync Support (more than 32 slots server)
- Linux Support
- Live Console
- Auto Restart on failure detection
- Auto Restart on schedule
- Password brute-force protection


## Installation
First, make sure you have:
- NodeJS v10+ (If you have problems with node-gyp/bcrypt/discord.js try downgrading to Node v10 LTS)
- FXServer [(duh)](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/)
- One TCP listen port opened for the web server
- Git (only for installs and updates)

To **INSTALL** FXAdmin execute:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tabarra/fivem-fxadmin
$ cd fivem-fxadmin
$ npm i
```
Copy your `server-template.json` to `server.json` and modify it according to your preferences. The most important settings:  
- `global.fxServerPort` is your fxServer port as configured in your `server.cfg`.
- `monitor.restarter.schedule` is the restart schedule. The time MUST be in the 24-hour format with two digits for hours as well as minutes (`HH:MM`). Leave the array empty or set it to false to disable the feature.
- `fxRunner.buildPath` is the folder containing the files `run.cmd`, `fxserver.exe` and a bunch of DLLs in case of Windows, and only `run.sh` in case of Linux.
- `fxRunner.basePath` is the folder that **contains** the `resources` folder, usually it's here that you put your `server.cfg`.
- `fxRunner.cfgPath` is the absolute or relative path of your `server.cfg`.

Do the same thing to your `admins-template.json`.  
To generate the hashed password, you can use tools like [this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt) and [this](https://bcrypt-generator.com) or even [this one](https://passwordhashing.com/BCrypt).  
  
To **RUN** FXAdmin execute:
```bash
$ npm start server.json
```

**Note:** You should run FXServer **through** FXAdmin, and not in parallel (ie in another terminal).  
**Note2:** To configure your Discord bot, follow these two guides:  [Setting up a bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) and [Adding your bot to servers](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).  


## Troubleshooting
### If you run into any problem, check our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md). 


## Updating
To **UPDATE** FXAdmin execute:
```bash
$ git pull
$ npm i
```
Make sure there's no differences in the json templates. If there is, copy the new template and edit again.  

## TODO:
- [ ] Add custom commands to the config file
- [ ] Add hitch detection
- [ ] Add fxadmin_version fxserver svar
- [ ] Config tester check for the modules inside `package.json` (require.resolve?)
- [ ] Config tester kill spawned fxserver after 5 seconds

And more...
- [ ] Add a `more info` tab and include some config variables, and the complete PID breakdown
- [ ] Separate the DANGER ZONE commands into a separate tab with confirmation dialog?
- [ ] We have data, we should plot it into a graph...
- [ ] Write a simple `manage_admins.js` script to help with the process. The current `/getHash?pwd=xxx` is counterintuitive at best.
- [ ] Get JSONC compatibility. Inline documentation for the configs would be great.
- [ ] Add machine performance data to the panel. Or not, perhaps that's a little too much into Grafana's land.
- [ ] Average the CPU measure by the last 6 seconds or so?
- [ ] Multiple server support? Technically easy, but would require massive rework of the interface.
- [ ] FXServer artifact/build auto updater???
- [ ] Automagically send messages in discord when starting/stopping/restarting the server
- [ ] Configurable discord bot static responses. This should be a separate file like the admins one.
- [ ] Discord bot extensions via required js files? Imagine typing `/whitelist @username` and the bot cross referencing the vRP id via the discord:xxx identifier. Or a `/me` giving back this users vRP stats like cars, wallet, bank, apartments & etc.
- [ ] Improve fxRunner/actions responses. Currently it's only 'Done'.
- [ ] Add some sort of detection to see if there is a fxserver running outside fxadmin on the same port.
