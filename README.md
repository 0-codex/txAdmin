- Auto Restart on failure detection
- Auto Restart on schedule
- Password brute-force protection
- Set FXServer process priority

## Installation
First, make sure you have:
- NodeJS v10+ (If you have problems with node-gyp/bcrypt/discord.js try downgrading to Node v10 LTS)
- FXServer [(duh)](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/)
- One TCP listen port opened for the web server
- Git (only for installs and updates)

**1 -** To **INSTALL** txAdmin execute:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin
$ cd txAdmin
$ npm i
```

**2 -** Copy your `server-template.json` to `server.json` and modify it according to your preferences. The most important settings:  
- `global.fxServerPort` is your fxServer port as configured in your `server.cfg`.
- `monitor.restarter.schedule` is the restart schedule. The time MUST be in the 24-hour format with two digits for hours as well as minutes (`HH:MM`). Leave the array empty or set it to false to disable the feature.
- `fxRunner.buildPath` is the folder containing the files `run.cmd`, `fxserver.exe` and a bunch of DLLs in case of Windows, and only `run.sh` in case of Linux.
- `fxRunner.basePath` is the folder that **contains** the `resources` folder, usually it's here that you put your `server.cfg`.
- `fxRunner.cfgPath` is the absolute or relative path of your `server.cfg`.

**3 -** To add an admin execute:
```bash
$ npm run admin-add
```
If you want to manage existing admins you must edit the JSON file yourself. Make sure your admins file folow `admins-template.json`. To generate the hashed password, you can use tools like [this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt) and [this](https://bcrypt-generator.com) or even [this one](https://passwordhashing.com/BCrypt).  
  
**4 -** To **RUN** txAdmin execute:
```bash
$ npm start server.json
```

**Note:** You should run FXServer **through** txAdmin, and not in parallel (ie in another terminal).  
**Note2:** To configure your Discord bot, follow these two guides:  [Setting up a bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) and [Adding your bot to servers](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).  
**Note3:** Although **not recommended**, you can set FXServer processes priorities. To do so, change `fxRunner.setPriority` to one of the following: LOW, BELOW_NORMAL, NORMAL, ABOVE_NORMAL, HIGH, HIGHEST.


## Troubleshooting
### If you run into any problem, check our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).   
If you are having trouble starting the FXServer via txAdmin, run `npm run config-tester server.json` and see which test is failing.  

## Updating
To **UPDATE** txAdmin execute:
```bash
$ git pull
$ npm i
```
Make sure there's no differences in the json templates. If there is, copy the new template and edit again.  
If you have any problems with the `package-lock.json`, just delete it and try again.  


## Interface Rework Progress:
- [x] make 80% of all pages html/css (in php)
- [x] remake webUtils templating
- [x] port all pages to node
- [x] Complete full status page
- [x] Complete admin log page
- [x] Complete live console page
- [x] Fix login page + add username
- [x] Autenticate every console message
- [ ] Fix xss from fxserver to browser
- [ ] Implement 500ms buffer for the live console broadcast
- [x] Re-add login name to all logging functions
- [ ] Clean webUtils
- [ ] Adapt getStatus endpoint and integrate
- [ ] Make dashboard funcionalities work
- [ ] Player modal endpoints
- [ ] Execute cmd buffer modal
- [ ] Code fxserver beta resource
- [ ] Server restart/stop confirm modal with option to kickall
- [ ] Update available notice box (and move the checkUpdates method)
- [ ] Make player history chart work



## TODO:
- [ ] Add custom commands to the config file
- [ ] Config tester check for the modules inside `package.json` (require.resolve?)
- [ ] Config tester kill spawned fxserver after 5 seconds
- [ ] Investigate the "fxserver has stopped working" not disappearing when autorestarter kills the server (probably windows detaches it? in that case we would need to PID map and then kill them one by one?)

TODO Ideas...
- [ ] We have data, we should plot it into a graph...
- [ ] Get JSONC compatibility. Inline documentation for the configs would be great.
- [ ] Multiple server support? Technically easy, but would require massive rework of the interface.
- [ ] FXServer artifact/build auto updater???
- [ ] Automagically send messages in discord when starting/stopping/restarting the server
- [ ] Discord bot extensions via required js files? Imagine typing `/whitelist @username` and the bot cross referencing the vRP id via the discord:xxx identifier. Or a `/me` giving back this users vRP stats like cars, wallet, bank, apartments & etc.
- [ ] Add some sort of detection to see if there is a fxserver running outside txAdmin on the same port.

The old TODO can be found [here](docs/old_todo.md).
